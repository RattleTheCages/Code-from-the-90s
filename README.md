# Code-from-the-90s

In the late nineties, I created a C++ library in which I was this ... close to acquiring venture capital start-up funds to start a company to be in competition with Rouge Wave and others.  (And possably STL which came out soon after.)  The dot-com bubble burst, and all the venture capital funds dried up.

This library includes many templates for items such as linked-lists, binary search trees (self balancing and thread safe), threads, sockets and more.
There is also a language I wrote called OLP, object language protocol.  And a compiler that would take OLP and create objects in C++ and Java, complete with serialization and unserialization functions such that, right out of the compiler, the C++ object and the Java object could exchange information over a serial transmission, e.g. a socket or file.  The compiler also provided SQL to create tables in the object's image.  Also generated is insert and select queries that can be used to update the C++ and Java objects associated.
The Artificial intelligence engine included went beyond what Rouge Wave was offering.  This machine learning engine uses a genetic algorithm to provide evolutionary learning.  The examples, included here, shows how the artificial intelligence engine and be used to solve word puzzles in just a few generations.
Part of what all this encompasses was to provide libraries and APIs to build self optimizing general purpose servers, something that was not available at the time.
